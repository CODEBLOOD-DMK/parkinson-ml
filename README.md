Detecting Parkinson’s Disease – ML using Python


Parkinson's disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement. Symptoms start gradually, sometimes starting with a barely noticeable tremor in just one hand. Tremors are common, but the disorder also commonly causes stiffness or slowing of movement. It has 5 stages to it and affects more than 1 million individuals every year in India. This is chronic and has no cure yet. It is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting dopamine-producing neurons in the brain.


We will be using a new machine learning algorithm known as XGBoost (xTreme Gradient Boosting). XGBoost is a designed with speed and performance in mind and is based on decision trees. In this project, we will import the XGBClassifier from the xgboost library. This is an implementation of the scikit-learn API for XGBoost classification.


OBJECTIVE: To design a Machine Learning model which accurately detects the presence of Parkinson’s disease in an individual.


LIBRARIES: In this project we will be using Python Libraries for Data science like Scikit-learn, NumPy, pandas and xgboost and we will build the model using an XGBClassifier.
